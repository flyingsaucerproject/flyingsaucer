 *   http://www.badgers-in-foil.co.uk/projects/docbook-css/
 *
 * This is the 'driver' file of the stylesheet.  It imports all the major
 * stylesheet components.  If you want to make use of this stylesheet in your
 * XML document (e.g. for display in a web browser), include a line like this
 * at the top of the XML file (replacing <ver> with the version number):
 *
 *   <?xml-stylesheet href="docbook-css-<ver>/driver.css" type="text/css"?>
 *
 * If you want to customise the stylesheet, a customisation layer can be
 * created by simply witing a new CSS file, and including a declaration to
 * import this file at the top.  The customisation layer can then override any
 * of the existing stylesheet rules, or create new ones.
