 * Revision 1.37  2004/12/10 06:51:02  tobega
 * Shamefully, I must now check in painfully broken code. Good news is that Layout is much nicer, and we also handle :before and :after, and do :first-line better than before. Table stuff must be brought into line, but most needed is to fix Render. IMO Render should work with Boxes and Content. If Render goes for a node, that is wrong.
