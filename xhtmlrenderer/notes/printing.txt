printing notes


the printing subsystem should

be in it's own package
affect the rest of the core as little as possible
support as much native features of printers as possible
print to color if possible
use the @media attribute to style correctly
scale so that point based fonts are sized correctly

72pt font = 1 inch high (ascend+descend or X height?)

setting widths by absolute units should be correct
    width = 1in  -> box 1 inch wide
    
should break pages where appropriate
should repeat table headers when table goes over multiple pages

adjust graphics to account for imageable area

should be really simple to create browser action to do printing

always smooth fonts

support pages of different sizes

support various printing and breaking css properties

browser should be able to add it's own printing enhancments
    url at bottom
    date
    margin and border adjustments
    duplex/mulit-plex printing
    turn on and off header repeats

(should we be moving to font glyphs and vectors?)
