===========

unit test space collapsing w/ images
implement tab alignment for pres
unit test tab alignment
implement media support for printing and test it
    make financial table demo print differently
make graphic2drenderer not use basicpanel
spruce up photo background
build demo w/ fixed pos menu, hovers, and scrolling
make all demos webstartable
codify the demo html editor
jtable -> report -> printed doc demo

form elements are still broken
if width set on body abs still goes relative to viewport width, not
body width.  the default block formatting context should be at the top most block's size, not at the viewport size.

line-height isn't working for Alice dropcap

============
notes of the changes that tobe has made

fixed:Whitespace only inlines are not being dropped. they produce anonymous inlines that take up some screen space.

fixed: Anonymous Inlines are picking up border, padding, and margins from their parent. Only element inlines should inherit those.

fixed: the document box width is too big, making everything on screen too wide.

floats are broken
the extra space at the top of the splash page collapses
tables are broken
hovers are broken
abs pos list items on game screen are missing
fixed bg images are broken

============
thoughts on an fs game

tetris game with fleets of ships falling down
there is a skyline of buildings that you must fill up.
when you clear a line there is a big ID4esque explosion
alien bombs can blow large areas
if you match the same color ship to a building it blows up the building?
humans build up new levels of buildings below in the subways and underground tunnels. eventually you get to the core of the earth and blow up the planet.
little animated people build stuff below
alien virus can poison the humans and slow them down
go from city to city
cities evolve over time. start w/ pyramids, move to cooler stuff over time.
spaceships are drones.
kamakazi ship w/ alien in it
aliens watch from mother ship at top which drops drone ships

pro version would have level packs.
purchase levels individually from an itunes like store
purchase w/ free gift copies to give to others
target at non-traditional gamers.

"Invading the earth, 5 minutes a day!"

create a head to head version.

humans invade alien planet version

humans and aliens team up version
============
thoughts on another game.
instead of a game that blows things down, what about building things up?
if you had to construct buildings to reach certain goals?
reach a light bulb?
rescue dog from a burning building?
