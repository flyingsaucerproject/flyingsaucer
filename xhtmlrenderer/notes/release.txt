quick start:  ant test-box

This is the first release of JoshyHTML, with a better name to be chosen later.
It's goal is not to be a webbrowser, but an XHTML Strict + CSS renderer. There
is no network code in it at all, in fact. It accepts a DOM and renders it in a
scrolling panel. You could make a webbrowser out of it, but since it only
supports XHTML Strict there would be a lot of work to massage the incoming html
and css. Not impossible though.

I have tried to minimize the tag specific code. I have used a CSS file for
defaults as much as possible. For example, the code doesn't know that h1 tags
are supposed to be bold and 20pts. It just knows to put a break after an h1 tag.
The rest of the style comes from the default CSS file (test.css) which allows
you to redefine the defaults if you want.

======== Tags Supported ================
Currently the browser supports the following tags:


body, p, h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6, b, i, div, image, ul,li


not supported yet:
span, table, ol, code, pre, dt, em, a, address, or any of the other random
inline tags.

No style information can be specified via elements. You must use CSS.
(actually, width is currently specified via the width attribute on divs,
but that will go to CSS soon as well)


img supports the src tag and can read anything that the javax.swing.ImageIcon
can read (ie, gif, png, and jpg). 


======== CSS Properties ==============
div supports borders, margins, padding, and backgrounds with colors or images that tile ( the repeat, repeatx, repeaty properties work)
all of the text elements (p, h1, b, i, etc) support foreground colors and font-style (normal and italic), font-weight (normal and bold), font-size (pt's only), and font-family (serif, sans-serif, and monospace)

No other styling is provided yet. What should we work on first?

No shorthand properties are supported yet. ie:

div {
    /* this won't work */
    border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px;
    /* this will work */
    border-top-width: 1px;
    border-right-width: 1px;
    border-bottom-width: 1px;
    border-left-width: 1px;
}

======= CSS specification ============
Style via CSS can be specified with an inline <style> tag in the header or by modifying the defaults in test.css.


======= CSS Selectors ================
Selection of rules works by class and element. IDs and compound and pseudo class selectors do not work.

/* these work */
div {   }
div.myclass { }
.myclass { }
*.myclass { }

/* these don't work *

#myid { }
div p b { }
a:hover { } 


========= future work ================'
I am looking for someone who would like to make a browser out of this, even if it's just used for things like help files. Anyone interested?
