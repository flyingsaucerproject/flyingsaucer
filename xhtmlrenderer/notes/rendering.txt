plan for the new rendering model


the first thing is to not do multiple passes.
layout should not be called from paint.
layout should return a block instead of a rectangle.
the blocks should be saved as children
paint should take a block instead of an element
implement the rest of the caching later.


//add a child list to Box
//modify layout to use the child list on box
//modify layout() and paint() to use boxes
//modify box layout and inline layout to use the boxes


//fix crash w/ tables (inline issue?)
//fix bad rendering w/ lines
//separate layout and paint into separate passes
//fix bad rendering w/ lists
//fix crash w/ inline images

//fix nested boxes
//fix bad table rendering
//recativate replaced elements
fix bad rendering w/ preformatted text
//reactivate fixed
//reactivate relative
//reactivate float
fix anonymous text block support


define the origin and context flow

the x and y of a box is relative to the inner bounds of the containing box
the available width is relative to the inner bounds of the containing box
painting:
    the border and background are painted relative to the inner bounds of the containing box
    the contents of a box are painted relative to the inner bounds of the box,
    ie 0,0. (not the inner bounds of the containing box)
    


dealing with anonymous text blocks
inserting a new tag to wrap the text blocks in seems like a bad idea since
it would be hard to undo
i will have to modify the inline layout's nexttext node search to look for
block boundaries
first i need to come up with a bunch of test cases for all possible scenarios
