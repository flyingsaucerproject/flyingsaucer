new ideas

the float will go to the inner edge of it's containing block or the previous float
a float must establish a new block formatting context
top of box is at top of current line box
if not enough room on the current line and there is previous float that it's next to, then shift down until there is room or no previous float.
block boxes don't shrink. line boxes do.


context.getBlockFormattingContext()
context.getContainingBlock()
context.setBlockFormattingContext()

blockformattingcontext.addFloat(block,direction)
blockformattingcontext.translate(x,y)
bfc.isFloatPresent(current line block)
bfc.getLeftFloatDistance(current line block)
bfc.getRightFloatDistance(current line block)
bfc.getFloatBottom(current line block)

tests:
1    span that does nothing
2    span that becomes a left float in a single paragraph with 5 lines
3    span that becomes a left float in a para w/ 1 lines
4    span, float left, 2 para, float extends to second para
5    three paras. middle one floats to the left

*    span float left in big para with long word that must shove down
*    span float left with next span w/ clear to shove down
*    two span floats left, in one big para
*    two spans float left and not enough room so wrap to next line, in one big para
*    5 spans float left w/ different heights in one big para w/ float wrapping
*    5 spans float left w/ long words and images and wrap to next para    
    span float right in a single para

plan for abs
create new bfc if none there (put in block layout())

//abs dif in upper left
//abs div in upper right
//abs div 10px from left
//abs div 10px from right
//abs div down 10 px
//abs pos centered w/ both sides auto?
//abs div with 50% width

abs pos centered vert w/ both sides auto?
abs with height 50%;
abs div 10px above bottom
abs span (turns into block?)
nested blocks and inline content inside abs div
abs div left inside abs div right

need to figure out how to handle repaint optimization on absolute positioned blocks where it's way outside of it's
parent block

plan for floating

when looping through text to create inline
boxes, if we come across a replaced element
that is set to float, first try to place the
element on the line. if it can go on the line
then float it. if it has to go on the next line
then move it to the next line and float it.

to float an element, set it's x to the current
float tab for the correct float side.
move the current linebox to the left or right.
add it to the float tab, where appropriate.

for each line box, reduce it's available width
to account for the current vertical float tab.

subtract from the vertical float tab if tab > 0


--------

floating block level elements.
the element will have to become a new box and then
floated as if it was an image. it needs an intrinsic
w/h. i don't know what the w/h will be if it doesn't
have them set via css. probably expand the width to the
width of the containing block.

the plan.


modify the routine which figures out if we are doing a block or inline context
    to skip floated blocks when searching for blocks.

for the inline calculation
    after the isReplaced add a isFloatedBlock() which does basically
    the same thing.
    
    though it's really a block we will create an inlineblockbox which
    is a subclass of inline and contains a reference to the real blockbox
    inside of it.
    
    modify the paint routine to look for isFloatedBlock() and do the same
    thing as isReplaced()

---------

* floating block level elements in a block context :

the element must have an w/h set explicitly or set to the minimum size
modify the test for block context routine to skip floated blocks
modify the layout children in block mode to move floated block to the side
add storage of tabs
add shortening of block via tabs
add decrement tab y for each time through
store a block box for each child in the list of children (already there?)

-----------

floating elements and having the float continue down to the next enclosing
block.

first, we need to store the float tabs in the context
then, when doing translations, the floats need to be translated as well
