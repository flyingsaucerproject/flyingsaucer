/*
 * $Id$
 *
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.21  2007/05/21 21:47:30  peterbrant
 * Final CSS clean up
 *
 * Revision 1.20  2007/02/20 17:23:14  peterbrant
 * Optimize fingerprint calculation
 *
 * Revision 1.19  2007/02/19 14:53:37  peterbrant
 * Integrate new CSS parser
 *
 * Revision 1.18  2006/07/28 10:08:56  pdoubleya
 * Additional work for support of parsing content and quotes.
 *
 * Revision 1.17  2005/12/28 00:50:53  peterbrant
 * Continue ripping out first try at pagination / Minor method name refactoring
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2005/10/24 10:19:40  pdoubleya
 * CSSName FS_ID is now public and final, allowing direct access to the id, bypassing getAssignedID(); micro-optimization :); getAssignedID() and setAssignedID() have been removed. IdentValue string property is also final (as should have been).
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2005/06/19 23:02:38  tobega
 * Implemented calculation of minimum cell-widths.
 * Implemented border-spacing.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2005/06/15 17:27:37  pdoubleya
 * Allow for custom properties (don't break).
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2005/05/08 15:37:27  tobega
 * Fixed up style caching so it really works (internalize CascadedStyles and let each CalculatedStyle keep track of its derived children)
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2005/01/29 20:19:21  pdoubleya
 * Clean/reformat code. Removed commented blocks, checked copyright.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2005/01/29 16:02:30  pdoubleya
 * Fixed case where null CSS name is passed for a PD factory; this is valid on testing (use default factory).
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2005/01/29 12:07:37  pdoubleya
 * Changed to use array for PD factories.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2005/01/25 14:45:56  pdoubleya
 * Added support for IdentValue mapping on property declarations. On both CascadedStyle and PropertyDeclaration you can now request the value as an IdentValue, for object-object comparisons. Updated 99% of references that used to get the string value of PD to return the IdentValue instead; remaining cases are for pseudo-elements where the PD content needs to be manipulated as a String.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2005/01/24 19:01:08  pdoubleya
 * Mass checkin. Changed to use references to CSSName, which now has a Singleton instance for each property, everywhere property names were being used before. Removed commented code. Cascaded and Calculated style now store properties in arrays rather than maps, for optimization.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2005/01/24 14:54:32  pdoubleya
 * Removed references to XRProperty (unused).
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2005/01/24 14:36:30  pdoubleya
 * Mass commit, includes: updated for changes to property declaration instantiation, and new use of DerivedValue. Removed any references to older XR... classes (e.g. XRProperty). Cleaned imports.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2004/12/11 18:18:07  tobega
 * Still broken, won't even compile at the moment. Working hard to fix it, though. Replace the StyleReference interface with our only concrete implementation, it was a bother changing in two places all the time.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2004/11/28 23:29:01  tobega
 * Now handles media on Stylesheets, still need to handle at-media-rules. The media-type should be set in Context.media (set by default to "screen") before calling setContext on StyleReference.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/11/16 10:39:34  pdoubleya
 * Made members all private where appropriate.
 * Comments.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/11/15 12:42:23  pdoubleya
 * Across this checkin (all may not apply to this particular file)
 * Changed default/package-access members to private.
 * Changed to use XRRuntimeException where appropriate.
 * Began move from System.err.println to std logging.
 * Standard code reformat.
 * Removed some unnecessary SAC member variables that were only used in initialization.
 * CVS log section.
 *
