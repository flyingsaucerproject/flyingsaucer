 * Revision 1.11  2005/10/20 20:48:05  pdoubleya

 * Mass checkin. Changed to use references to CSSName, which now has a Singleton instance for each property, everywhere property names were being used before. Removed commented code. Cascaded and Calculated style now store properties in arrays rather than maps, for optimization.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/01/24 14:36:30  pdoubleya
 * Mass commit, includes: updated for changes to property declaration instantiation, and new use of DerivedValue. Removed any references to older XR... classes (e.g. XRProperty). Cleaned imports.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/11/15 12:42:23  pdoubleya
 * Across this checkin (all may not apply to this particular file)
 * Changed default/package-access members to private.
 * Changed to use XRRuntimeException where appropriate.
 * Began move from System.err.println to std logging.
 * Standard code reformat.
 * Removed some unnecessary SAC member variables that were only used in initialization.
 * CVS log section.
