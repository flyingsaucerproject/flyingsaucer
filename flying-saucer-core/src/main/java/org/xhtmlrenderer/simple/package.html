<p>Includes those classes you need to render XHTML documents
quickly, right out of the box, and with no special setup needed; start here! All the classes
in this package are oriented towards ease-of-use. You should be able to render documents on screen,
convert them to image files and print them with almost no work at all. We'll document the most
important classes here; see the individual class documents for details on how to use them in
your programs.</p>

<p>All classes in this package are intended for ease-of-use, with no customization
required. To render a document quickly, use {@link org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.XHTMLPanel}--just instantiate
the panel, add it to a scroll pane or {@link org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.FSScrollPane}, and call 
{@link org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.XHTMLPanel#setDocument(Document)}. You can render from a {@link org.w3c.dom.Document},
from a {@link java.net.URL}, from a file, and from an {@link java.io.InputStream}.</p>

<p>The {@link org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.Graphics2DRenderer} allows you to render XHTML right to image files--
without displaying them onscreen at all. You can use any XHTML/XML/CSS combination and
dump it straight to a JPEG, GIF, or other file format supported by the Java image APIs.</p>

<p>{@link org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.FSScrollPane} is a JScrollPane with key bindings for scrolling through a document--
just as you would expect from a browsable XHTML document. Drop your {@link org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.XHTMLPanel}
in a {@link org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.FSScrollPane} and your users can move up or down by line or page, and jump to
the start or end of the document, just as they are used to.</p>

<p>{@link org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.XHTMLPrintable} supports the AWT {@link java.awt.print.Printable} interface,
allowing you to print a document without rendering it onscreen first.</p>
