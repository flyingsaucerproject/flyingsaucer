XML-APIs (extracted from Apache Xerces-2)
http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/
License: Apache v2
We include the xml-apis.jar from the Xerces binary distribution in order to allow
our code to compile on JDK 1.4, which does not include newer XML APIs, even though
these API implementations will run on version 1.4 of the JRE. The JAR is unmodified
from the Xerces release, but is renamed as xml-apis-xerces-2.9.1.jar to
make the version clear.
Included as lib/xml-apis-xerces-2.9.1.jar
