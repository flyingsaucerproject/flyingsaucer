## Flying-saucer-core-nextgen

The Flying-saucer-core-nextgen module is where development of new features and 
adding support for modern HTML standards can be implemented.

It uses the JSoup HTML parser, which supports modern HTML syntax.

Ideas:
======
* CSS 3
  https://github.com/phax/ph-css

* HTML 5 support.

* JavaScript support:
It would also be interesting to use Rhino, which is an open-source implementation 
of JavaScript written entirely in Java:

* HtmlUnit is a "GUI-Less browser for Java programs".
