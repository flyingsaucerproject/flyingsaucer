GETTING FLYING SAUCER
---------------------
New releases of Flying Saucer are distributed through Maven.  The available artifacts are:

org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-core - Core library and Java2D rendering
org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-pdf - PDF output using iText
org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-swt - SWT output
org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-log4j - Logging plugin for log4j

GETTING STARTED
---------------
There is a large amount of sample code under the flying-saucer-demos directory.
A pre-configured Eclipse project is provided to run a few of them.  

For users of other IDEs, make sure the src/java and resources directories under
the about, docbook, svg, and browser directories are available on the build
path.  samples/src and splash should also be in the build path.

flying-saucer-core, flying-saucer-pdf, and flying-saucer-swt must also be on the
build path as well as the an SWT JAR for your OS.

The Eclipse config files as committed with flying-saucer-swt use a Linux SWT
JAR.  You will need to update if using another OS.

org.xhtmlrenderer.demo.browser.BrowserStartup will start the browser demo.

Some good entry points (classes) are:
org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.XHTMLPanel
org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.PDFRenderer
org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.ImageRenderer
